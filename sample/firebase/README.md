###`:sample:firebase`

This is a sample demonstrating using the SDK when it has to be coupled with an already existing
firebase implementation.

For this the project is using a
[mock-google-services.json](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/blob/master/mock-google-services.json)
from the `quickstart-android` Firebase repository. **Please don't' forget to replace it with
your own `google-services.json` file if you want it to work as it is**.
